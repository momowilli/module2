It’s good you came&mdash;she says.<br>
You heard a plane crashed on Thursday?<br>
Well so they came to see me <br> about it.<br>
The story is he was on the passenger list.<br>
So what, he might have changed his mind.<br>
They gave me some pills so I wouldn’t fall apart.<br>
Then they showed me I don’t know who.<br>
All black, burned except one hand.<br>
A scrap of shirt, a watch, a wedding ring.<br>
I got furious, that can’t be him.<br>
He wouldn’t do that to me, look like that.<br>
The stores are bursting with those shirts.<br>
The watch is just a regular old watch.<br>
And our names on that ring,<br>
they’re only the most ordinary names.<br>
It’s good you came. Sit here beside me.<br>
He really was supposed to get back Thursday.<br>
But we’ve got so many Thursdays left this year.<br>
I’ll put the kettle on for tea.<br>
I’ll wash my hair, then what,<br>
try to wake up from all this.<br>
It’s good you came, since it was cold there,<br>
and him just in some rubber sleeping bag,<br>
him, I mean, you know, that unlucky man.<br>
I’ll put the Thursday on, wash the tea,<br>
since our names are completely ordinary&mdash;
